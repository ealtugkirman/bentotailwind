            that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You
            can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by
            refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location
            setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you

          <p>
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
            otherwise required by law.
            <br /> <br />
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
            <br /> <br />
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            7. What are your privacy rights?
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you
            have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your
            personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
            account at any time.
            <br />
            <br />
            In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain
            rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the
            right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal
            information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to
            restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if
            applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may
            also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
            information. To make such a request, please use the contact details
            provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in
            accordance with applicable data protection laws.
            <br />
            <br />
            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
            information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness
            of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the
            processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
            lawful processing grounds other than consent.

            8. Controls for Do-Not-Track features
          </h2>
          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
