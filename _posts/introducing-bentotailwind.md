## Why are we doing this?

When I was the owner of DigitalVoyage.agency, I designed many bento grids for myself and customers. We had many customers complaining about design and coding time, and I've been frustrated with working with custom grid elements ever since.

More recently, as a developer, I once again had to deal with custom bento grids, and coding and developing took time. After looking at all the different solutions out there, I've been obsessed with the idea of solving this problem once and for all.

As I started to dig deeper, it became clear that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Designing Bento Grids is the biggest pain point, so I started collecting bento grids on Tailwind CSS.

## What problem are we solving?

We're building a Modern Component Library platform, and we're starting with Bento Grids. The idea is for you to design Bento Grid with easy-to-use features without having to worry about responsiveness and good looks. Think of it as a next-generation Bootstrap.

## Why now?

When you look at all the other biggest libraries, you'll notice that they were all using the same styles that most developers can design easily. Because of that, it's common to see simple websites almost all over the web. Nobody is building an exceptional developer experience. Nobody is trying to innovate.

There isn’t a single Bento Grid Library platform in the market today. We want to change that. We need to stop designing grids like it's 2010 and rethink how grids can be done in 2024 and beyond. Designing Grids needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build frontend today.
